 State Space Error Correction Model Toolbox for MATLAB

# Acknowledgement
This code base has been evolved from old functions written by Martin Wagner and myself. 

A lot of functionality is added in the course of the DFG funded project "EICIP" (Estimation and Inference in CoIntegrated Processes). To this project three then PhD candidates contributed a lot:
+ Rainer Buschmeier (Bielefeld University)
+ Patrick de Matos Ribeiro (TU Dortmund and Bielefeld University)
+ Lukas Matuschek (TU Dortmund and Bielefeld University)
